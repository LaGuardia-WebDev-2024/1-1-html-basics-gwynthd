      lyrics
    </h2>
     <p>
       Baby, baby
There will always be a space for you and me<br>
Right where you left it<br>
And just maybe<br>
Enough time will pass<br>
We'll look back and laugh<br>
Just don't forget it<br>
And maybe I'm wrong
For writing this song
Losing my head over you
Baby, baby
There will always be a space for you and me
Right where you left it
And just maybe
Enough time will pass
We'll look back and laugh
Just don't forget it
And maybe I'm wrong
For writing this song
Losing my head over you
